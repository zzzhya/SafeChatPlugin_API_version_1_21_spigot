# SafeChatPlugin_API_version_1_21_spigot
SafeChat Plugin for Minecraft Java Edition built with intelliJ (Spigot version 1.21 API) by zhya

Easily filter out words using SafeChat
Create .txt file "notallowedwords" in your server folder

Add the words you want blocked each on a new line
- Example:

- badword1

- badword2

- badword3

Usage:

ON&OFF in game command: /safe

NOTICE:

This is my first Minecraft plugin. If you intend to use it, please take the precautionary steps of securing who has access to the command, by either using a third-party plugin for managing permissions (Eg;LuckPerms) or another way of your choice. By default, the /safe command can be toggled by any user, as it is not defined in the code.
Tested on Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.4
