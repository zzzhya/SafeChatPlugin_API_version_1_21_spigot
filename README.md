Easily filter out words using SafeChat!
Create .txt file "notallowedwords" in your server folder

Add the words you want blocked each on a new line
- Example:

- badword1

- badword2

- badword3

![exampletxtfileloadedcorrectly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a15343f-dc41-4a39-a415-d1afffbacda9)

SafeChat interacts dynamically using both "notallowedwords" and config.yml files (either can be adjusted for adding new words, although the .txt is easiest)

Usage:

ON&OFF in game command: /safe

NOTICE:

This is my first Minecraft plugin. If you intend to use it, please take the precautionary steps of securing who has access to the command, by either using a third-party plugin for managing permissions (Eg;LuckPerms) or another way of your choice. By default, the /safe command can be toggled by any user, as it is not defined in the code.
Tested on Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.4
